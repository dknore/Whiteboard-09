# Whiteboard-09:  Reverse an Integer

Directions:<br>
Write a function called `reversed()` that:
- Accepts an Integer as a parameter
- Returns a new integer with all the digits reversed. 

Note:<br>
- Only use common math operations like ` +/-, *, /, % `. 
- You may use ` Math.floor ` to help with rounding.
- Do not arrays. 
- Do not use strings.
